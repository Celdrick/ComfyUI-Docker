|args |description

|--lowvram
|If your GPU only has 4GB VRAM.

|--novram
|If adding __--lowvram__ still out-of-memory.

|--cpu
|Run on CPU. It's pretty slow.

|--use-pytorch-cross-attention
|If you don't want to use xFormers. This may perform well on WSL2, but significantly slower on Linux hosts.

|--preview-method taesd
|Enable higher-quality previews with TAESD. ComfyUI-Manager would override this (settings available in Manager UI).

|--front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend@latest
|Use the most up-to-date frontend version.

|--fast
|Enable experimental optimizations.
Currently the only optimization is float8_e4m3fn matrix multiplication on
4000/ADA series Nvidia cards or later.
Might break things/lower quality.
